# simpsons-mnist
:file_folder: A small MNIST-like The Simpsons character database to at least have some fun while training neural networks

## TODO

- [ ] Take inspiration from https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist
- [ ] Include some stats even though this dataset differs from the pure MNIST-like train/test sizes
- [ ] Open to public once the dataset is properly documented and prepared
- [ ] Check whether the dataset can be better prepared like centered images, etc
- [ ] Explain how to use this dataset to benchmark your models in:
   - [ ] TensorFLow
   - [ ] PyTorch
   - [ ] PyTorch Lightning
- [ ] Let the users know that the repository is open to contributions
- [ ] Include benchmark table to encourage users to train nets using this dataset
- [ ] And more things but I'm tired of typing now...
